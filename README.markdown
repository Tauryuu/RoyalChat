RoyalChat
=========

RoyalChat is a *simple* (three line config file) chat manager for your Minecraft server. It uses permissions to assign group names and prefixes (and suffixes) to your liking. Everything is configurable by you.

RoyalChat is coded in Eclipse 3.7.1 with the following libraries:

 * bukkit-1.0.0-RC2-SNAPSHOT.jar

### About the developer

My name is Kyle Clemens. I run a cracked [Minecraft server](http://royalcraf.tk) at royalcraf.tk, write (currently) three different plugins: RoyalCommands, RoyalChat, and RoyalMisc.
RoyalMisc is only available on RoyalCraft.

I currently attend school and hope to continue learning Java to better this plugin.
